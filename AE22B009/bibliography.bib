journal = {Japanese Journal of Applied Physics},
abstract = {The car concentration on an expressway must obey the Burgers equation if the concentration is linearly related to the drift speed. The power spectral density of the random Burgers flow was numerically evaluated based on this model and compared with the observed spectrum of the car flow. They are in approximate agreement.}
